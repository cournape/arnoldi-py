# arpack-py

This is an attempt to write an eigensolver for sparse matrices without
depending on ARPACK. Ultimately, the hope is to be a viable replacement for
scipy.sparse.eigen.arpack, and remove the fortran dependency.

## Why ?

ARPACK-NG is a fortran library for sparse eigen solvers. It has the following issues:

- the fortran code is not thread-safe. In particular, it is not re-entrant
- it does not incorporate some of the more recent improvements discovered for
  large problems, e.g. A Krylov-Schur Algorithm for Large Eigenproblems, G. W.

        - According to [https://discourse.julialang.org/t/ann-arnoldimethod-jl-v0-4/110604](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/ann-arnoldimethod-jl-v0-4/110604), it is more stable than ARPACK.
        - implementation ~ 2k julia (not including tests)
        - license compatible with SciPy (MIT-like)
