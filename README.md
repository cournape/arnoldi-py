# Arnoldi

This is an attempt to write an eigensolver for sparse matrices that only relies
on NumPy and BLAS/LAPACK, without depending on ARPACK. Ultimately, the hope is
to be a viable replacement for scipy.sparse.eigen, and remove the fortran
dependency.

## Why ?

ARPACK-NG is a fortran library for sparse eigen solvers. It has the following issues:

- the fortran code is not thread-safe. In particular, it is not re-entrant
- it does not incorporate some of the more recent improvements discovered for
  large problems, e.g. A Krylov-Schur Algorithm for Large Eigenproblems, G. W.

## TODO

- [ ] Basic support for symmetric/hermitian matrices, largest eigen values only
    - [ ] add a basic set of test matrices, using sparse matrix suite + synthetic
    - [ ] add basic unrestarted Lanczos algorithm
    - [ ] add convergence tracking on Ritz values
    - [ ] add block + full reortho
    - [ ] try implicit / explicit restart (notebooks)
    - [ ] add locking / deflate
    - [ ] partial reorthogonalization
    - [ ] try krylov-schur method
- [ ] add support for shift-invert (arbitrary eigen values)
- [ ] extend to Hermitian/symmetric matrices (Arnoldi)

        - implementation ~ 2k julia (not including tests)
        - license compatible with SciPy (MIT-like)
